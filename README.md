# DuetToolChanger
configuration files for an E3D toolchanger using a Duet board

These files work on F/W Version: 2.02. I know that this is not the latest-and-greatest. I will perform the update and modify my scripts after ERRF. This will cause issues with how 'global' and 'tool' offsets are handled.

These files are exclusively meant for research purposes. Under no circumstances would I recommend directly copying these files to your system.
